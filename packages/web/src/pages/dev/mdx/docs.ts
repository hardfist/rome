// The MDX design docs, and the only place a new one is registered.

// MDX is the format because a design note can render the thing it describes:
// the prose and the live component sit in one file, against the real tokens
// and the real primitives, so "what it should look like" and "what it looks
// like" cannot drift apart the way a screenshot in a Markdown file does.
//
// Dev-only, like everything under /dev — this module is reached from
// DEV_ROUTES, which is the empty array in production builds.

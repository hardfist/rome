// The two writes that decide an account: dismiss it, or restore it to nobody's
// decision. What they mean is the account contract's (@rome/api-types/people);
// where they are stored is the stranger sentinel, which is what "dismissed" has
// always been in this database.
//
// Neither verb invents storage. A dismissal is a channel mapping onto the
// sentinel — the row `/persons/mark-stranger` has always written — and a
// restore is that row's removal. What is new is that both are addressed at an
// account rather than at the sentinel, and that neither can reach an account a
// real person holds: linking and unlinking are that account's verbs, and a
// dismissal that quietly displaced a placement would lose the guardian's work.
//
// The account, not the addressing. A channel that reaches one account several
// ways is folded by `readAccountDirectory`, so a caller holding any address of
// an account decides the account — otherwise a dismissal by the address the
// guardian happened to see would leave the account undismissed by every other
// one.

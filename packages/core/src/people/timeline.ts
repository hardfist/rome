/**
 * Each store paired with the accounts it owns: the first store that holds an
 * account takes it, and no later store is offered it.
 *
 * The rule exists because the stores overlap rather than partition. One inbound
 * WhatsApp message is a `wa_messages` row, a `rome_agent_messages` row on the
 * channel session, and — when the sentinel triaged it — a `sentinel_log` row as
 * well. Merging all three renders one message three times, and the copies carry
 * different ids at different timestamps, so no after-the-fact dedupe survives a
 * page boundary. Instead each account's history comes from exactly one store.
 *
 * Ownership is derived rather than asked for: a store that answers a `latest`
 * for an account is a store that holds it, and `Messages` states that `latest`
 * is the head of the very history `read` pages. A separate "do you hold this"
 * verb would be a second answer to the same question, free to disagree with the
 * first — a row previewing an entry from one store while the page beneath it
 * opens on another's.
 *
 * The one place the rule is applied. Every read of a person's history — the
 * page here, the summary in activity.ts — goes through this, because a summary
 * that claimed accounts on its own terms could count an exchange the page
 * attributes to a different store.
 *
 * One `latest` per account, and the whole store's worth raised before any is
 * awaited: an adapter that groups the calls of a tick — every SQL one does —
 * settles a whole directory's ownership in one pass over the store rather than
 * one per row.

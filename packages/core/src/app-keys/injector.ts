 * - The real process environment always wins. A name that already had a value
 *   before injection is never overwritten — operator config (env files, CI,
 *   container env) cannot be shadowed from the dashboard. Such keys are
 *   reported as overridden instead of silently going live.
 * - Only names this injector set are ever deleted or scrubbed. It tracks its
 *   own writes, so removing a stored key can never unset an operator-set var
 *   that happens to share the name.

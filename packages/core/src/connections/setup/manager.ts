// In-memory connection setup sessions keyed by addressed grant.
//
// One active setup per addressed grant. The key is the connection id the setup
// route resolved (real connection) or the bare service name (offerable
// placeholder that has no row yet), joined with the grant. A duplicate start on
// a live setup re-attaches to it; `force` cancels-and-replaces (explicit cancel
// then start begins fresh). Sessions do NOT survive a process restart
// (resurrection is deferred — `ctx.step` keeps the door open). A finished setup
// stays reachable by `cid` for a final poll, but no longer counts as the grant's
// active setup, so the next start begins fresh.
//
// The manager owns the terminal write: when a coroutine returns its conferral,
// the manager hands it to `registry.confer` inside the registry's per-(service,
// grant) critical section. `confer` resolves the ADDRESSED connection (never
// blindly `find()[0]`, which could clobber a different connection of the same
// service), mints the placeholder for the offerable flow, persists the
// credential + profile, and runs the guardian channel mapping — ALL in one DB
// transaction. A mapping failure rolls the credential and the mint back with it,
// so a failed conferral leaves zero residual state instead of a credential
// authorized while the setup reports `failed`.

# API Surface

How traffic reaches the Rome backend: every external caller arrives over one HTTP listener, and every [action](../concepts/actions.md) worker calls main over one fork IPC channel. This doc owns the constraints that keep those two transports apart, and the delegation rules on the worker channel. [`access-control.md`](access-control.md) owns who an HTTP caller is and what it may reach. The cross-service protocol contracts with [Rome Cloud](../concepts/rome-cloud.md) — [instance sign-in](../concepts/rome-cloud.md#instance-sign-in) and the [OAuth handoff](../concepts/rome-cloud.md#oauth-handoff) — live on the concept.

## HTTP surface

A single server hosts every HTTP route behind the [edge](access-control.md#request-flow). Four categories share the listener: the dashboard API with its websockets, the access-gated [app surfaces](access-control.md#policies), the [public allow-list](access-control.md#request-flow), and the webhook ingress. [`access-control.md`](access-control.md) owns the per-category auth and the fail-closed default. The callers are concepts entries — [guardian](../concepts/people.md#guardian) and [visitor](../concepts/people.md#visitor).

### Invariants

- One listener serves the whole HTTP surface. The edge and the direct backend origin expose the same route set — a second listener does not exist, and a route hidden from the edge does not exist.
- Worker-to-main traffic never rides HTTP. A service a worker needs joins the [Worker RPC](#worker-rpc) surface, never a route.

## Worker RPC

The main process creates every worker that runs a cancellable [action](../concepts/actions.md) out of process, and it holds a direct fork IPC channel to each one. A worker never forks a worker. A worker that needs a nested subprocess action delegates it to main. A worker that starts intentionally independent work asks main to dispatch a new root. Either way main spawns the target worker on a channel of its own. The operating-system process tree stays flat while execution ids carry the logical action tree ([decision](../adrs/workers-never-fork-workers.md)). What a caller observes — the nested cancellation lifetime, the detached acceptance receipt, the root-cancel cascade — is an [action contract](../concepts/actions.md).

### Invariants

- Only main creates workers, and no worker relays a call for another ([decision](../adrs/workers-never-fork-workers.md)).
- A pending RPC never outlives its peer: timeout, disconnect, or worker exit rejects it.
- Delegated action execution has no duration deadline. It ends on result, root cancellation, owner-worker disconnect, child exit, or main shutdown — never on elapsed time.
- Cancelling a root follows the logical action tree, not the process tree: every worker running under that root terminates, including workers main spawned on another worker's behalf.
- The transport is core-internal. The app-facing runtime names no IPC primitive, and an app-level invocation behaves identically in main and in a worker — every invocation carries [fork IPC semantics](../adrs/ipc-semantics-on-every-action-invocation.md) in both processes.

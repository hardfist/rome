/**
 * app_management — Drive the Rome app lifecycle (create / install / uninstall /
 * enable / disable) from an agent turn.
 *
 * `install` is the single install/upgrade primitive. `source.mode` declares
 * what the target is, and the daemon cross-checks it against the directory's
 * actual shape: `source` = the app's repo root (the daemon builds, packs
 * into `<repo>/.rome/artifact`, and installs — the one-step dev path),
 * `bundle` = an already-packed artifact installed as-is, `appstore` = fetch
 * from the Rome App Store. For Store installs, omit `version` to install the
 * latest live version, or pass a specific live historical version from
 * `app_store_search` listing detail. The daemon installs runtime deps before
 * activating the bundle in every mode. Install is an awaited completion
 * barrier: it returns only after the built bundle is active and the runtime
 * catalog has reloaded it, so callers do not need to poll deployment state.
 *
 * `uninstall` deletes the bundle and (optionally) purges DB tables + data;
 * `set_enabled` toggles the enabled flag without re-installing.
 *
 * First-party apps (shipped with Rome) are bundled at build time and
 * installed at boot. `uninstall` rejects them with FIRST_PARTY_PROTECTED;
 * `set_enabled` is the only lifecycle control that applies to them.
 *
 * @example
 *   await callAction("app_management", {
 *     op: "create",
 *     appId: "notes",
 *     rootPath: "/absolute/path/to/dev/working/tree",
 *     template: "default",
 *   });
 *   // Edit the scaffold, then a single install builds + packs + installs.
 *   // No appId — the daemon derives it from the source and returns it:
 *   await callAction("app_management", {
 *     op: "install",
 *     source: {
 *       mode: "source",
 *       path: "/absolute/path/to/dev/working/tree",
 *     },
 *   });
